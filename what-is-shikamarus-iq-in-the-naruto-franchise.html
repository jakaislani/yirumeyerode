In the Naruto Character Official Data Book, Kishimoto noted that he likes Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature and would marry him if he were a girl. During Part II of the series, Shikamaru begins smoking cigars. Kishimoto considered censoring these scenes due to a fear of negatively influencing the target demographic, but he decided to keep them in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Naruto-Shikamaru-Nara.jpg><p data-characters=46 data-current-count=346 data-injectable=false>But how intelligent exactly is Shikamaru Nara?</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true>Due to his lack of enthusiasm, Shikamaru enjoys cruising through life with minimal effort.
