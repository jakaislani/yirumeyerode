Onion rings on a burger? A charcoal bun? Even more bacon? Snore. Enter Burger King, which introduced chicken fries in the early 200s. If you’ve never heard of chicken fries, it’s understandable. They haven’t always been a main menu item. But they’re back now, and they’re not exclusively at Burger King—you can buy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">frozen chicken fries</a> at the grocery store. Today, we take a closer look at this holy union between chicken and fry. Dr. Moreau, eat your heart out (but save room for all these chicken fries).&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-are-chicken-fries><strong>What are chicken fries?</strong></h2><p>Chicken fries are long, finger-sized strips of chicken coated in seasoned bread crumbs and fried. They were first launched as a special Burger King menu item in 2005, but earned permanent status in 2015. These days, you can get them at any Burger King establishment along with a myriad of dipping sauces such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ranch</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">barbecue</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buffalo</a>. (There used to be a chicken fry sauce, which was a mix of BBQ and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">honey mustard</a>, but Burger King discontinued it.) As noted above, you can also find frozen chicken fries from brands like Tyson and Yummy at the grocery store.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BEST_FROZEN_CHICKEN_FINGERS_HEADER-1170x658.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-best-frozen-chicken-fries>Best Frozen Chicken Fries</h2><p>So, you can get frozen chicken fries at the grocery store, but what are the best frozen chicken fries? We found them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-are-chicken-fries-made-of><strong>What are chicken fries made of?</strong></h2><p>BK chicken fries are technically classified as chicken fingers, because, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">QSR</a>, they’re made from strips of whole muscle chicken breast. They’re breaded with a mix of flours, starch, spices, seasonings, and things like “dextrose,” which we see on ingredient labels a lot but couldn’t pick out of a line up of powders. Tyson any’tizers chicken fries, on the other hand, are not specifically made with chicken breast.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-are-chicken-fries-real-chicken><strong>Are chicken fries real chicken?</strong></h2><p>Well, they sure aren’t pork, folks! Yes, chicken fries are made of crispy fried chicken strips in the shape of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">french fries</a>.</p><p>Chicken fries are something we firmly believe should be in the same conversation as cheeseburgers and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mozzarella sticks</a>. Perhaps, one glorious day, they’ll get their time to shine, and when it does, we’ll be there…with honey mustard and BBQ sauce firmly in hand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFurdGeZJygmZi4prqMn6minaNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ronan-farrow.html><span>←</span><span>Ronan Farrow Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
