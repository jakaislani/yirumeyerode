That’s been the gist of his experience on the set of the third season of Hulu’s Only Murders in the Building beside the likes of Meryl Streep, and Andrea Martin.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>“I’ve had many ‘I can’t believe I’m in this room right now’ moments,” Rudd told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ET</a> at the Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania premiere on Monday. It turns out even Marvel heroes can be intimidated.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>Rudd first appeared in the show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">during the finale for its second season</a> as Ben Glenroy, Charles’ Broadway cast mate who, after getting into an ominous argument with the latter, collapses and dies on stage, creating a major cliffhanger that will definitely turn into a central plot point in season three.</p><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=150 data-injectable=false>The Ant-Man actor had nothing but good things to say about the show’s fabulous leading threesome, Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez.</p><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>“I’ve worked with Selena [Gomez], she’s a really good friend of mine. I adore her,” Rudd said of the “Lose You to Love Me” singer. The two co-starred in the Netflix drama The Fundamentals of Caring back in 2016. In Only Murders in the Building, Gomez plays Mabel, one of the building’s residents who becomes close with Steve Martin’s Charles and Martin Short’s Oliver when they try to solve the murder of her friend Tim Kono in season one.</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=346 data-injectable=false>Comedy veteran legends Martin and Short, are “Mount Rushmore” for Rudd, while Andrea Martin, who plays Charles’ make-up artist and love interest Joy, is a “homerun hitter.” The cherry on top? <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">21-time Academy Award nominee, and three time winner, Meryl Streep</a>, who’s also just joining the show in season three.</p><p>“And then you pan over and it’s Meryl Streep! So yeah, she’s a bit of a powerhouse,” Rudd said coyly.</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>Shooting for season three was announced by Gomez with an epic Instagram post showing the mega-talented bunch just casually hanging out. Streep gives Martin a pillow, and Short asks for tea. Just a normal day, then.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>Since it’s so early on in production, there isn’t an official release date for season three of Only Murders in the Building just yet, but with a group so exclusive, anyone would be counting the days for the premiere.
