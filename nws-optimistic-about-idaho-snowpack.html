By December 4, 2022, some snow basins were more than double the average size for that time of the year. Willow, Blackfoot, Portneuf was the biggest outlier, sitting at 207% of what it normally was.</p><p>A change in the jet stream slowed things down. NOAA National Weather Service Morning Coordinator Meteorologist Jay Breidenbach spoke on the lack of wet weather in Idaho at the turn of the year.</p><p>"In late December and early January, the pattern shifted so it was hammering that jet stream right into Central California so they had all that flooding, and we dried out a little bit when that happened," Breidenbach said.</p><p>Still, Breidenbach and several NWS Boise meteorologists were optimistic about the Gem State's snowpack.<br></p><p>"We've had a drought across the southern part of the state, so an above-normal snowpack, especially in the southern half, is really good news for the overall water supply," Breidenbach said.</p><p>North Idaho, specifically the panhandle, is lagging behind the rest of the state. As of February 7, 2023, three snow basins are below average.</p><p>Breidenbach was not very concerned about North Idaho's lesser snowpack, noting that while the next few months would be crucial, it's likely the region catches up.<br></p><p>"There's still a chance, a really good chance actually, that the panhandle region, the northern half of the state catches up to normal," Breidenbach said.<br></p><p>Ultimately, the direction of the jet stream over the next few months will determine what peak snowpack will look like.</p><p>Breidenbach noted the recent shift of the jet stream back toward the Pacific Northwest and suggested that could remain active for a month or even longer.</p><p>"It has briefly shifted back into the area and it does look active over the next month, and probably two months, so I would expect that to continue to add to the snowpack so good news for skiers, and good news for our water supply," Breidenbach said.<br></p><p>The water supply is essential to getting Idaho out of its long-term drought. Breidenbach said that it is unlikely a single winter could pull Idaho out of that drought, but mentioned that it would go a long way toward helping the Gem State.</p><p>Reservoirs would reap major benefits from additional snowpack, as the trickle-down water would keep reservoirs filled, for longer periods of time too.</p><p>The graphics below show Idaho snowpack on Feb 7, 2023, Feb 8, 2022, Feb 8, 2007. 2023 is stronger than 2022 in nearly every snow basin. 2007 is also shown, which was a notable year when the snowpack was very light.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihlJa1sLrEsKpnm5%2BifLixwK2fnqpfo8S0ec6pq6KlmajBqq%2BMmpmoraRitqWtx6hkrKafrL2ir8o%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./june-carter-cash.html><span>←</span><span>June Carter Cash - Death, Songs &amp;amp; Movie</span></a>
