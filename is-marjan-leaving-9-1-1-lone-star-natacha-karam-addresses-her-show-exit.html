It was a heavy scene. There was a lot of sadness in the room. No one had seen the next scripts, so even as actors we didn’t know. It was like, ‘Okay. Well, when am I going to get to work with all of you again as characters?’ It was extremely sad,” she told EW.</p><p>“Everyone knows she wants to be a firefighter at the 126 more than anything, but now she feels like she can’t. There’s kind of this paralysis within her that’s set in. And everyone’s just watching it and knows that there’s nothing they can do. I think everyone felt really helpless watching her drive off, and no one knew what was coming next,” she continued to explain of the scene.</p><p>As for the future?</p><p>“It’s not like Marjan is just going to come right back and start working at the firehouse again. That is not the arc of this season. She is gone. She’s out of state. She is alone. She’s off on her own adventures, which the audience will get to follow her on — but not right away.”</p><p>9-1-1: Lone Star airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>Meanwhile, one star is teasing her potential return to the series!</p><p>Post source: <a href=#>Justjared</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tooaNiuqK%2ByZqlZqSVlsOqusZmcGZpXWZ6rbvNnmSsrJGneq%2Bt05qaoZldoK6zrcxmmJ2coprAtLHSZp%2Beql2otbDDjJ6voqxf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-a-romero-net-worth-3.html><span>←</span><span>George A.
