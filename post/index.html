Whatever Kevin Feige says about the MCU goes. By nature of his status as Marvel Studios president, he has the ultimate say on the cinematic universe’s canon. He could announce that the entire Marvel multiverse is actually a dream imagined by some kid with a snow globe and we’d have no choice but to believe him.

Recommended Videos Whenever a collection of classic games is released, I always find myself picking it up. Despite not usually having nostalgia for these retro packages (as my first console was the Genesis), I enjoy learning more about the medium that I love, and they’re typically a good way to experience games that I missed out on. Unfortunately, a lot of these end up being hit-or-miss; for every one&nbsp;game I end up loving, there are often a handful of titles that are only interesting to look at through a historical lens.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Grand Theft Auto V - The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 6GB Founders Edition Review: Not Quite Mainstream</h2><time>Sep 15, 2024</time>

Grand Theft Auto V (DX11) Now a truly venerable title, GTA V is a veteran of past game suites that is still graphically demanding as they come. As an older DX11 title, it provides a glimpse into the graphically intensive games of yesteryear that don't incorporate the latest features. Originally released for consoles in 2013, the PC port came with a slew of graphical enhancements and options. Just as importantly, GTA V includes a rather intensive and informative built-in benchmark, somewhat uncommon in open-world games.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Nina Derwin</h2><time>Sep 15, 2024</time>

For the past year and a half, 3dfx has been the first to launch the next product cycle; first, with their Voodoo2 and then with the Voodoo3. This time around, NVIDIA is stealing the thunder with the release of their GeForce 256. The recently announced product is designed to be a departure from NVIDIA's TNT architecture and a migration towards a new series of graphics cards. In reality, the differences between the GeForce 256 and the previous TNT2 and TNT cards are not incredible in terms of numbers but they are very well defined.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Helena Zengel Wiki, Height, Age, Family, Biography, &amp;amp; More</h2><time>Sep 14, 2024</time>
