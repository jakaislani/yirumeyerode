A 2 year old text! It’s no secret that we’ve said a lot of horrible things about each other both publicly and privately when <a href=# rel=noopener>we hated each other</a>. So has Melissa, so I’m not sure why she is highlighting something she has said herself… and she’s family. (Jackie too!),” Jacqueline wrote in a comment shared by Taste of Reality on <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>. “I’m so happy Teresa and I have resolved things since then and are back to being Lucy and Ethel for life like we always should have been.”</p><p>“Can’t wait for you to visit me in CA Teresa!

She is a low life trash bucket. She’s stupid, but also very calculating. Even with her two facelifts, eye lift, nose job, shaved forehead, Botox, fillers, and new boobs she is still so ugly and thinks she’s a goddess. Lol! No, I’m not bitter at all! Lol! Every time I see something on her, it irritates me all over again. (OBVIOUSLY! Lol!) She’s infamous for being a dumb, classless train wreck. She doesn’t get it,” Jacqueline had written.</p><p>And in texts between herself and Jackie, Jacqueline was just as anti-Teresa, describing her as the “worst human.”</p><p>“I hate how everyone kisses her a– and bows down to her … She’s trash,” she stated.</p><p>“If everyone would quit kissing her a– and letting her rule and instead just stand up to her and say how they really feel about her, it would be awesome!” Jacqueline continued. “They are just followers. It’s actually pathetic. She’s not even the cool girl at school. She’s a joke to laugh at because of how dumb she is.”</p><p>The Real Housewives of New Jersey&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>season 13 reunion</a>&nbsp;concludes next Tuesday, June 13, with part three at 8/7c on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toopGYvraxy6KlnmWclsKztdOaZKykkaLAbrnEpaCsq5Fis7C%2BjKWcmqOVmXq1sdetZKimXamys7HSmmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-william-broderick-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does William Broderick Crawford Make?
