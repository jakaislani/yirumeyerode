The food kingdom is a bit like the animal kingdom‚Äîfrom the smallest to the largest, all edible creations have their place. And to continue that metaphor, seeds are sort of the ants of the food world‚Äîsmall, seemingly insignificant, and yet they have an important role to play. Among these minute foodstuffs, the flaxseed is one of the humblest.
