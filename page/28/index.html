Writer/director Lucile Had≈æihaliloviƒá ("Innocence") respects and preserves the mysterious, brooding energy that ushers adolescent Nicolas from one revelation to the next. This is, after all, a story about characters who know more than they care to admit and the moments that force them to change or die.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/27/>‚Üê Prev Page</a>
