During her career, Ike and Tina recorded an album titled "Nutbush City Limits" that featured a popular song of the same name. At 16 years old, she moved to St. Louis, Missouri. In 1956, she met her future husband Ike Turner, who, at the time, was the guitarist and bandleader of the group Kings of Rhythm. Ike took an interest in Anna Mae, and soon, the teenager was performing as the lead singer in Ike's band.</p><p dir=ltr>Originally, Anna Mae went by "Little Ann" in her first days with the group. However, Ike convinced Anna Mae to change her stage name to Tina, which she did. With the name change, the band's name went from the Kings of Rhythm to the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. Ike remained the bandleader and commanding voice in the group, while Tina became the frontwoman and lead singer. During this time, the two began their romantic relationship, and the couple married <a href=#>in 1962</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAkHJwcW9fm66tv8Rmq6GhnpzAbsXOrmSbnZyesrexjJqZqK2kYsGqusBmq66qnpq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-i-mix-pumpkin-with-dog-food.html><span>←</span><span>Can I mix pumpkin with dog food?</span></a>
