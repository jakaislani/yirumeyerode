I barely knew anyone there and on my day off, there was a snowstorm. I decided to walk to the theater in town and there was "Ice Castles." It was just the perfect combination of everything for my loneliness. I fell into a reverie. Yes, Robby's tighty whities helped. But there also was something about Lynn-Holly Johnson that was special. She felt authentic, both on the ice and off.</p><p><b>CHRISTY LEMIRE</b>: Because she wasn't a "great" actress. But I'm not sure she needed to be. You're right—there was a purity and naiveté to her that made her authentic.</p><p><b>SUSAN WLOSZCZYNA</b>: I just connected with her. Also, the milieu, given that I was in the Finger Lakes area in a small, working-class town.</p><p><b>SHEILA O’MALLEY</b>: I totally agree with this. She is sweet and sincere and quite believable, I thought, in some very difficult scenes (particularly the one with <a href=#>Colleen Dewhurst</a> in the attic).</p><p><b>CHRISTY LEMIRE</b>: And clearly they needed someone who could actually skate, but also could hold her own opposite those kinds of veterans. Right now, <a href=#>Margot Robbie</a> is training to play Tonya Harding, and while she has the acting part down, she has to learn how to skate—which is even harder, I think.</p><p><b>SHEILA O’MALLEY</b>: They also built in the fact that she was somewhat "behind" the other skaters. A little bit older, self-trained, not as polished. So it worked, I thought. She was good enough to make you believe that audiences would take to her.</p><p><b>SUSAN WLOSZCZYNA</b>: She wasn't a goody-goody girl, either. She had sass and ambition, but never in an obnoxious way. But, since she is 16, I did wonder, seeing the movie again, if she even went to school.</p><p><b>SHEILA O’MALLEY</b>: Can we talk about the score? I just re-watched it and had forgotten just how much Marvin Hamlisch's song was used as a motif throughout. It's sentimental, for sure, but dammit it works.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmnKCRr8BursuonmismKe8trPHZquhnV2axqa%2FjKidZqSfq7Juu81mq6GdXam2rrHLnqqsppWowG67xWagnJ1dmK60wMueqg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./romeo-and-juliet-1968.html><span>←</span><span>Romeo and Juliet movie review (1968)</span></a>
