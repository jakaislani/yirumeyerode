To some, this sounds hellish. To others, the routine and repetition may seem divine. For us here at Sporked, we just want to know what we’d be stuck eating.</p><p>We asked members of the Mythical Crew which grocery store product they would eat forever if they were stuck in a perpetual Groundhog Day scenario. Here are their very delicious answers. And if anyone was wondering, I’d choose <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">frozen dumplings</a>.</p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Mikayla Barnes</strong></a>, Good Mythical Morning Associate Producer<p>If Mikayla had to bring one food to a desert island (or Punxsutawney, as it were), she’s grabbing Trader Joe’s Mini Chicken Tikka Samosas. I get why! They’re one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best frozen appetizers you can get at Trader Joe’s</a>. These crispy little pockets of meat are so well seasoned. Plus, you don’t typically see chicken samosas in restaurants, so they’re unique!<br></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Brittany Van Horne</strong></a>, Good Mythical Morning Head Writer<p>If Brittany were stuck in a perpetual loop of the same day, she would stay snacking on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cheddar & Sour Cream Baked Lay’s</a>. Obviously, we agree. They took the top spot in our ranking of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best baked chip</a>s! They are arguably better than regular Cheddar & Sour Cream Lay’s. A baked chip being better than a regular chip?! Unheard of.<br></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Jasmine Williams</strong></a>, Mythical’s People & Culture Coordinator<p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marie Callender’s Chicken Pot Pie</a> is Jasmine Williams’s one true love, a food that she would never want to stop eating. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We like them too</a>! This pot pie is so dang nostalgic and comforting, and I wouldn’t mind eating it every day either.<br></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Matt Carney</strong></a>, Good Mythical Morning Showrunner & Executive Producer<p>It’s already Groundhog Day for Matt because he currently eats <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Unique Original Splits Pretzels</a> every day. He says they’re the best pretzels he’s ever had. Fine, Matt! We’ll try them!<br></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Karolyna (KG) Garza</strong></a>, Good Mythical Morning Production Assistant<p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Carne Asada Burritos from Trader Joe’s</a> are KG’s Groundhog Day food of choice. She loves that it tastes like “actual carne asada” and “not just a weird mystery meat mush.” Plus, she appreciates their convenience. Eat your TJ’s burrito like KG and top it with salsa verde.<br></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Annaliese Kassebaum</strong></a>, Mythical Kitchen Senior Producer<p>Annaliese is all about the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chili crisp</a>. I mean, who isn’t? It’s delicious! She told us she could eat this on scrambled eggs every single day. If a Groundhog Day situation were to arise, sounds like Annaliese would be fine.<br></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Cara Powers</strong></a>, Personal Assistant to Rhett & Link<p>The product that Cara could eat every day is the Swiss Almond Cheese Spread from Aldi. She refers to it as a “gift from the gods.” We have never tried this product, but now we simply must!<br></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Jake Elder</strong></a>, Good Mythical Morning Assistant Editor<p>Jake’s pick for Groundhog Day dining is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kellogg’s Froot Loops</a>. He acknowledges that a bowl of sugary cereal isn’t exactly a substantial forever meal, but “at least [he would] be happy.” It’s a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">great cereal</a> so we can’t argue with him. Hopefully he remembered to get milk pre-Groundhog Day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFuwMeeZKaxpJ22pK3LZpqrnadixLDBy51knpmkYrK3sdGyZJ2ZqWK2r3nAZp6rp6Wjsam7xmabmrFdqLCmusCroKhn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adriana-barraza-bio-wiki-age-birthday-height-family-husband-daughter-net-worth-thor-city-of-angels-peliculas-movies-and-tv-shows.html><span>←</span><span>Adriana Barraza Bio, Wiki, Age, Birthday, Height, Family, Husband, Daughter, Net Worth, Thor, City o</span></a>
