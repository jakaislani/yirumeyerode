<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Evolution movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2016)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>We learn about Nicolas's world in increments, but not just because we are learning alongside Nicolas. This is a movie about the alien feeling that accompanies any natural process of adaptation. Writer/director Lucile Hadžihalilović ("<a href=#>Innocence</a>") respects and preserves the mysterious, brooding energy that ushers adolescent Nicolas from one revelation to the next. This is, after all, a story about characters who know more than they care to admit and the moments that force them to change or die. It's a movie about discovery, and it's the most novel, unsettling&nbsp;horror film of the year.</p><p>We learn so much about Nicolas based&nbsp;on Hadžihalilović's gorgeous nature photography. We watch as Brebant navigates the shores of a remote island landscape: loamy rocks cover a sulfur-grey beach while waves roar and crash on the shore. Hadžihalilović never lets us lose sight of the fact that Nicolas is, unlike his fishy-looking captors, seeing the world through human eyes: we tellingly don't see the ocean floor until we've already seen the skyline.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, we watch Nicolas from a distance, as we watch (from what appears to be a camera crane or maybe just through a wide-angle lens) when he travels across his island home, his path lit only by a small lantern. We know things he doesn't, as we see in scenes where Nicolas' nurses stoically watch medical footage of a Cesarean-section birth. But Nicolas understands that his world is unstable, that information is being withheld from him and that the status quo his mother enforces is ... well, off. He&nbsp;chokes down the weird gruel-like noodle dish she prepares for him, but based on his facial expression you can tell that on some level, Nicolas knows&nbsp;something is wrong. He likewise wants to trust nurse Stella (<a href=#>Roxane Duran</a>), an atypically curious companion who becomes like a surrogate mother to Nicolas after his real mother&nbsp;abandons him to hospital care. But Nicolas can't trust Stella, as we see in the scene where she practically drowns him when they go swimming together.</p><p>Hadžihalilović's direction is remarkably assured. She and cinematographer <a href=#>Manuel Dacosse</a> explain so much just using&nbsp;a dark color palette of seaweed-greens, brackish-greys, and azure blues. But Brebant's body language says almost as much, though it sometimes appears to be communicating relatively quietly. Take for example the scene where Stella&nbsp;asks Nicolas to see his drawings. She discovers his sketchbook completely by accident: she insists that they shower together once he is admitted to the hospital, though he resists the idea ("I can do it myself").&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46eraikpam2sLqMa2dqbg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-vegan-frozen-pizza.html><span>←</span><span>Best Vegan Frozen Pizza, Ranked [Taste Test]</span></a>
