Surprisingly, he didn’t meet Boogs until the day that they were set to debut on television together. Obviously, Nakamura was impressed with Boggs’ skills.</p><p>“Actually I met him for the first time at the SmackDown show last week. I didn’t know how great of a time he had, yeah.”</p><p>When it comes to the return of live crowd, Shinsuke Nakamura can’t wait to have fans back. He spoke briefly about how he exchanges that energy with fans which is the reason why he is a pro wrestler.</p><p>“With the live audience, I miss that situation, because I always exchange energy with audience. So, I get energy from the audience and I give back that energy to the audience. That is why I wrestle.”</p><p>We’ll have to see what is next for Shinsuke Nakamura on SmackDown. Rick Boogs is certainly an interesting element to add and the live crowds will certainly amp up that energy when WWE gets back to touring in July.</p><p><strong>What do you expect from Shinsuke Nakamura and Rick Boogs?
