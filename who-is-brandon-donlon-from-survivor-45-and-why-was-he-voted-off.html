Prior to being cast in the most recent season, Donlon was vocal about his devotion to Survivor, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">writing on Instagram</a> that he’d hoped to appear on the series since he was a child. So enduring is Donlon’s passion for the show, which he first watched at 11 years old, that he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">submitted auditions to be cast</a> long before he was even of the eligible age.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>Donlon says he was close to making the cut for Survivor 44, and undertook swimming lessons and fire-starting courses prior to being cast on the current season. In his Survivor bio, Donlon described himself as neurotic, but said he entered the experience to “have a lot of fun.” Donlon cites <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mike White</a> — who placed second in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">David & Goliath</a> — as his all-time favorite Survivor player.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Why was Brandon Donlon voted off Survivor 45?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>Donlon’s consistent struggles during challenges throughout his Survivor run were ultimately his downfall. After his ally, Hannah Rose, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">quit the competition</a>, Donlon was left at the mercy of his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lulu tribemates</a>, who credited his lacklustre challenge performances with his elimination in the second Tribal Council.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true>These struggles were immediately apparent in the first episode, when Donlon suffered a panic attack in the opening challenge when trying to climb a ladder. The incident saw him tended to by medical professionals, and unfortunately set the tone for following challenges while placing a target on his back among the other players.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>In honor of the Survivor and The Price Is Right crossover this evening, here is me cosplaying as a plinko chip <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/PMXVbroi0m</a></p>— Brandon Donlon (@BrandonDonlon) <a href=#>October 2, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=719 data-injectable=true>Lacking in the physical challenges — which also saw him struggle up a ramp in the first immunity test — Donlon promised his teammates of his strength at puzzles, but went on to lose three puzzle challenges by the game’s second cycle. In the end, Donlon’s teammates were forced to measure the value of the energy he bought to camp against his performance, and ultimately deemed him a liability to the Lulu tribe.</p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=271 data-injectable=false>Regardless of his short run, Donlon exited Survivor 45 with a smile, offering advice for viewers to “come and do this.” Donlon’s elimination dealt another blow to the Lulu tribe, who’ve had a rough start to the season plagued by over-zealous players and quitters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlkqeur7DOp2Sdp56hvK95xaumpmWjqr%2B3tdWoqWZsZWKur7CMsJ%2ByZaeWwG60xGatqKyVmXqwssVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-shikamarus-iq-in-the-naruto-franchise.html><span>←</span><span>What is Shikamarus IQ in the Naruto franchise?</span></a>
