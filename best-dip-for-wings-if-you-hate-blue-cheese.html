But you see how this presents a dilemma. A quandary. A veritable conundrum. A prickly predicament. A sticky wicket, if you are fancy like that. Point is, as someone who likes wings but not blue cheese, your girl still needs her toppings and I know there are many of you out there in the same situation. So, grab your drums and flats, because we are about to get saucy.</p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Marie’s Creamy Ranch Dressing + Dip</strong></a><p>Say it with me: Ranch. Should. Be. The. Standard. There are few things better in this life than buffalo wings absolutely soaked in ranch. Whether they’re from a wing place, an Applebee’s, or the freezer aisle, this combo will never not be a winner (blue cheese who?!). And this ranch is already thicker and richer than most ranches out there, perfect for the dippin’. Sporked senior writer <a href=#>Jordan Myrick</a> described it as “thick, creamy, and herby,” adding that there’s “absolutely zero weird chemical-y aftertaste or strange, unnecessary twang.” You need this ranch in your life and on your wings.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Ranch Dressings to Buy for Pizza, Wings, Salad—Oh My!</a></strong></p><p>BBQ sauce on wings is a classic on its own, no blue cheese necessary. And this BBQ sauce is the best one we could find. Jordan called this sweet and zesty BBQ sauce the “gold standard of BBQ sauce” and described it as having “a rich thickness that would cling perfectly to ribs or chicken or a big, juicy portobello mushroom.” Spoiler alert: it works on wings too. PUT IT ON ‘EM.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best BBQ Sauce for Becoming an At-Home Pitmaster</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Yellowbird Habanero Condiment</strong></a><p>There are few things better than hot sauce on wings, and this hot sauce is amazing at adding both a kick and a punch of flavor to whatever you use it on. This sauce has a hint of habanero fruitiness and tangerine juice but don’t worry, it is still VERY hot. The “fresh pepper flavor and citrusy zing” would ABSOLUTLEY bring any wing-eating experience to the next level. Find this hot sauce and give it a try.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">11 Best Hot Sauces Worth the Burn</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>First Street Buffalo Style Chicken Wing Sauce</strong></a><p>Ah yes, buffalo wings. Controversial opinion: Buffalo wings don’t necessarily need blue cheese to be good. They are great on their own (and made even better with a touch of ranch). And this buffalo sauce definitely holds up on its own. It’s thick and creamy and has a surprisingly complex flavor. Jordan noted how it “starts with a strong buttery flavor, works its way into vinegary notes, and then finishes with that signature buffalo sauce kick.” If you like buffalo wings, you need this sauce in your life.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best Buffalo Sauce for Game Day</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Pantai Sweetened Chili Sauce for Spring Roll</strong></a><p>Sweet chili sauce is underrated. There, I said it. I want to see it everywhere, on all things, and wings are indeed on my list of “all things.” Sweet-and-spicy chicken is a masterpiece, and sweet chili sauce is basically a shortcut to that neighborhood of Flavortown. Plus, this sweet chili sauce is top notch. Sporked editor-in-chief <a href=#>Justine Sterling</a> liked its “sweetness and mild tang” and pointed out how it is “flecked with pepper but not spicy.” Get this if you want glossy, sweet, tangy, lightly spicy wings (blue cheese could never).</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Sweet Chili Sauce for Egg Rolls, Chicken Nuggets, Your Fingers, Whatever</a></strong></p><p>Lastly, some sweet-and-tangy honey mustard. I never would have thought this would be a good combo, and then one day I had some wings with a honey mustard dip and my whole life changed. Or at least my opinions about mustard on wings changed, and my official opinion is now, “Yes, do it.” Plus, this honey mustard hits all the flavor notes you could possibly want. Our tasters noted that it has a “spicy dijon kick going for it, but there’s still some delightful sweetness as well.” If you are looking to up your wing condiment game, give this honey mustard a go.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Honey Mustard: The 7 Best Honey Mustards</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFusMipZJ%2BnomLEqrrGrGSinl2uvLZ5x5qrnmWSocKmecKhnJ6rlWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-caesar-salad-kit.html><span>←</span><span>Best Caesar Salad Kit [Taste Test]</span></a>
