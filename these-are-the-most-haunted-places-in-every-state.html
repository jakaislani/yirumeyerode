There's also a shimmering, floating phantom farmhouse that appears and disappears at random, never in the same part of the graveyard twice. Most famous, however, is the woman in white, known as the Madonna of Bachelor's Grove, seen carrying her baby around the graveyard under the full moon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCEmG9nam5fqbWmv8RmmKudXam1pnnMqKqtZZiWwq%2FAxJ1kqaSRmLK0ecinZJ6ulafGbr%2FTmqueZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./spike-lee-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Spike Lee Net Worth: How Much Is the Legendary Filmmaker Worth?</span></a>
