Gatorade is a boon, always a welcome sight in the refrigerator if you’re spent from working out or (more likely if you’re me) sick or hungover. But how much do we really know about Gatorade? Let’s find out. Here are some frequently asked questions about this popular sports drink.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-owns-gatorade><strong>Who owns Gatorade?</strong></h2><p>Gatorade is owned by PepsiCo (you had about a one-in-three chance of guessing right). It is currently the company’s fourth largest brand. Powerade, the second most popular sports drink, is owned by Coca-Cola.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-was-gatorade-invented><strong>When was Gatorade invented?</strong></h2><p>The sports drink was invented in 1965 by a team of researchers led by Dr. Robert Cade for use by athletes at the University of Florida, whose mascot is—you guessed it—the alligator. Thus, the name Gatorade was born.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-does-gatorade-have-electrolytes><strong>Does Gatorade have electrolytes?</strong></h2><p>You betcha. To be specific, there are 160 milligrams of sodium and 45 milligrams of potassium per 12 fluid ounces, both of which are types of electrolytes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-does-gatorade-have-caffeine><strong>Does Gatorade have caffeine?</strong></h2><p>Let’s take a look at the full nutrition label. Lemon-lime gatorade contains “Water, Sugar, Dextrose, Citric Acid, Salt, Sodium Citrate, Monopotassium Phosphate, Gum Arabic, Glycerol Ester Of Rosin, Natural Flavor, Yellow 5.” As you can see, caffeine is not a listed ingredient, making Gatorade caffeine-free.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-gatorade-gluten-free><strong>Is Gatorade gluten free?</strong></h2><p>It certainly is, making it a safe choice for those on gluten-free diets or with gluten intolerances.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-gatorade-an-energy-drink><strong>Is Gatorade an energy drink?</strong></h2><p>While Gatorade may help replenish your energy and leave you feeling refreshed, especially if you’re sick or working out and are in need of electrolytes, it is not considered an energy drink. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gatorade website</a> notes, “Many of the energy drinks contain caffeine and about three times as much carbohydrate as Gatorade, as well as other substances like ginseng, taurine, etc.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-do-gatorades-expire><strong>Do Gatorades expire?</strong></h2><p>Alas, all things must come to an end, and Gatorade is no exception. There is a label on the bottle indicating the “Best Buy” date. If you really want to push your luck or you’re in some sort of post-apocalyptic bomb shelter scenario, some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sites</a> online say you can drink it for nine months past the recommended date.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-flavor-is-cool-blue-gatorade><strong>What flavor is Cool <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Gatorade</a>?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Cool Blue Gatorade is in fact blue raspberry flavored. If you’ve ever wondered <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">what blue raspberry actually means</a>, it turns out it’s not really raspberry at all. It’s more of a tropical melange.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-can-you-make-cocktails-with-gatorade><strong>Can you make cocktails with Gatorade?</strong></h2><p>If you really, really want to do this, yes, of course you can. There are a number of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recipes</a> online, including for a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gatorade Margarita</a> containing Cool Blue Gatorade, tequila, limeade concentrate, salt, and blue sanding sugar. But can I also recommend the wide world of cocktails that don’t contain Gatorade? Consider that if you get hungover from drinking too many of these, you’ve nowhere left to turn.&nbsp;</p><p>Now you’re a Gatorade expert!
