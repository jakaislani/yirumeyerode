They did some heavy reframing and VFXing on some scenes in that.</p><p>— Mixed Nuts Mikey (@MixedNutsMikey) <a href=#>April 8, 2020</a></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/splash-desktop-wallpaper.jpg alt=Splash width=2552 height=1442 sizes="(max-width: 2552px) 100vw, 2552px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>Disney is king right now when it comes to movies. They own Marvel, Pixar and also an entire library of Fox films. And they aren’t afraid to edit some of their content. A post-credits scene from Toy Story 2 featuring Stinky Pete ogling two Barbie dolls is nowhere to be found, and the 1946 film, Song of the South, isn’t available at all on the streaming service due to it featuring scenes perpetuating racial stereotypes.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>That example makes sense. But editing that moment from Splash is completely unnecessary. After all, if you watch the original version, her hair still covers up her backside and you have to look really closely to see anything.</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>Disney wants to project an image of wholesomeness and family and that’s fine. They’re obviously doing something right being the most powerful movie studio on the planet. But this is taking things a bit too far. This scene in <strong>Splash</strong> isn’t sexual in any way and if anything, it’ll probably just drive kids to seek out the original shot.</p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=false>While it’s true that if you watch a movie on cable it’s edited for content, in the world of streaming, there really isn’t any of that going on. It’s up to parents to utilize parental locks. Disney is going one step further though by altering or censoring scenes themselves and this is really where the anger and frustration comes from. Not giving their customers the ability to make the decision on their own.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6KrnprGbrHDoquippdiu7awyK2wZqugoa60tIyfmKerXaq9tLHTaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-starbucks-iced-energy-drinks-news.html><span>←</span><span>Starbucks New Iced Energy Drinks: We Got a Sneak Peek</span></a>
