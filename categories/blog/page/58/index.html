As far as I'm aware, Poitier's swing was the first example in American movies of a black swatting a white -- and long overdue, I might add. About six months later, a curious Western named "The Scalphunters" came along in which Ossie Davis and Burt Lancaster pounded each other for about 10 minutes while standing in a mudhole.

Answer
Never connect numerous strands of Christmas tree lights together unless you are certain that the wire is rated to properly carry the power. If a section of the wiring for your Christmas tree lights is broken, you may wish to cut the wire to remove the damaged section and reattach the good sections of wire together.
Another topic is whether or not you can splice string lights together.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jeff Hornacek Net Worth</h2><time>May 21, 2024</time>
