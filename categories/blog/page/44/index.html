Delight in the refreshing flavors of melon and mint in this tasty Melon Mint Agua Fresca!
After years and YEARS of trying to grown mint…I have finally succeeded! I have had so many people write in with great tips and advice and I appreciate it all. I have been enjoying mint all summer long – in my morning tea, in mojitos, and especially in my favorite fruit salad.
I was out picking some mint leaves the other day and was apparently a little too enthusiastic and pulled a whole section of the plant out by it’s roots – whoops!</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Presumed Innocent Movie Was a Highlight of Hollywoods Page-Turner Era | Features</h2><time>Jun 18, 2024</time>

It had been decades since I watched the movie—though positively reviewed, it’s hardly held up as a great film or even one of Ford’s finest moments—and revisiting it last week, I was struck by how wonderfully competent it was.

<a href=../../../../best-feta.html></a>
The best feta cheese is firm and crumbly but still creamy. It’s tangy but rich. It’s great in salads and it also melts into pasta. And, while the actual best feta cheese is probably only found on some island in Greece, you can find some pretty good facsimiles in the grocery store. You can even find good vegan feta cheese these days.&nbsp;
For a long time, I thought all feta tasted pretty much the same—and I wasn’t a fan.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Alien Trespass movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2009)</h2><time>Jun 17, 2024</time>

Facing them are plucky locals, dressed in work clothes from Sears, standing behind their open car doors and looking up to match awkward special effects that are coming -- coming! -- this way! "Alien Trespass" doesn't bend over backward to be "bad." It tries to be the best bad movie that it can be. A lot of its deliberate badness involves effects some viewers might not notice. For example: bad back projection in shots looking back from the dashboard at people in the front seat.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Richard C.
