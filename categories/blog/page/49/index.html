<a href=../../../../passion-fish-1993.html></a>
The film stars Mary McDonnell as May-Alice, a soap opera star whose life is suddenly changed by fate. She has some money and a home down in the bayou country, where her family is from, and after she finishes with rehabilitation therapy (where she is a very poor candidate), she goes back down there to sit in her chair and drink wine and harbor her bitterness.
She has enough money to hire a full-time companion, and she interviews several of them, all with a lot of problems of their own.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Exorcist movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1973)</h2><time>Jun 9, 2024</time>

The difference, maybe, is between great art and great craftsmanship. Bergman’s exploration of the lines of love and conflict within the family of a woman dying of cancer was a film that asked important questions about faith and death, and was not afraid to admit there might not be any answers. Friedkin’s film is about a twelve-year-old girl who either is suffering from a severe neurological disorder or perhaps has been possessed by an evil spirit.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Pickled Eggs</h2><time>Jun 8, 2024</time>

In this pickled eggs recipe, red and yellow beets give the eggs their bright hues. I love to eat them as a snack or serve them as part of a spring brunch.

How CUTE are these pickled eggs?! They’re my new spring obsession, a grown-up substitute for the Easter eggs I dyed with my family as a kid. Back then, I colored my eggs with little bottles of food coloring, but in this pickled eggs recipe, I use natural ingredients instead.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>She Is Conann movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2024)</h2><time>Jun 8, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../she-is-conann-2024.html></a>
Throughout Conann’s multiple incarnations, one character stays consistent. Rainer (Elina Löwensohn)—a tribute to Fassbinder? Wouldn’t be surprising—is a perverse dog-faced oracle in a studded leather jacket who follows Conann all of her life, documenting her with his Instamatic camera and delivering some of the film’s juiciest lines. (“Blessed are the necrophiles, never betrayed by their love,” he remarks, surveying a pile of corpses left in warrior Conann’s wake.) Rainier serves as narrator, taskmaster, and all the Christmas ghosts wrapped up into one, reminding Conann of her commitment to barbarism (i.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The BEST Cornbread Dressing (Cornbread Stuffing)</h2><time>Jun 8, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../scorpion-review-cyclone-season-1-episode-3.html></a>
Recommended Videos Last week, I expressed some doubts about the show, and “A Cyclone” did address some of them, or maybe I just found Scorpion more entertaining this week than I did last week. Last week’s case and the character details we learned were all terribly trite and predictable, as the show leaned way too hard on typical nerd tropes. This week, the drama came out of the action and various dilemmas created as the team tried to solve the case.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/48/>← Prev Page</a>
