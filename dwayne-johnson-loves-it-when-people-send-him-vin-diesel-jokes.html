People were asking me about [making Diesel jokes] and they just, they find a way, and you know, what’s interesting is, you know, these Vin diesel jokes, which play great by the way to the audience, which is always a good thing because it’s all about [the audience]. But, people think these jokes come from me and they actually don’t. I mean, you’d be surprised at how many people come to me with ‘I got a great one.’ I’m like ‘okay.’ ‘I got another great Vin Diesel joke.’ ‘I’m sure you do.’ Always funny.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/142809457_842206949953387_7071248991777020474_n.jpg><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>Maybe one day they’ll kiss and make up, but for the time being it looks like the pair of beefy bulging bros will remain at loggerheads for the foreseeable future, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">although it isn’t going to hamper their respective action hero credentials </a>in any way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom7CZqaOybrbOoaWsp55iubDCxKxkoqxdrLWmuoypnKionJp6tLHNnWShoZ1iw6q6jJ2gnquVoXqru8qeqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-color-of-money-1986.html><span>←</span><span>The Color of Money movie review (1986)</span></a>
