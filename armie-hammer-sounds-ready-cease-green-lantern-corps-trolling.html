Yes, you may argue that the space cop could show up in <a href=#>Justice League</a>, but that seems pretty doubtful, especially when you consider that if any ringslinger makes a cameo, it may end up being <a href=#>Abin Sur</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKulmZp6qa3MppyrZaOkwq%2Bw0mapnpmUrnqkscCsnGafopqyr3nLmqWtnaKjeqS70amqZqyipLmttc2gZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-one-piece-is-real-twitter-meme-explained.html><span>←</span><span>The One Piece is real Twitter meme, explained</span></a>
